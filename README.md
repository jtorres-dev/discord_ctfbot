# Discord CTFBot

## Introduction
This bot is designed to fetch [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/) events and updates a text-channel in your Discord server. <br />

## Requirements
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Discord API Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) which will allow you to create a bot and generate a private token. <br />

## Get Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a bot with Discord [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy the private token: <br /> <br />

  <p align="center"><b>‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èKEEP YOUR TOKEN PRIVATE‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è</b></p><br />

3. In order to send CTF updates to your Discord server, you will need a designated `#text-channel` for the bot. Before you are able to get the text-channel ID needed for the bot, you will need to enable `Developer Mode` through your Discord settings: <br /> <br />

4. Once Developer Mode is enabled, right-click on the text-channel you want the bot to send updates to and select Copy ID: <br /> <br />

5. Open up `src/pwnbot.py` in your desired text editor and set the values for `BOT_TOKEN` and `BOT_CHANNEL` with your own token and bot channel ID: <br /> <br />

<p align="center"><i>Note: TOKEN is a string and BOT_CHANNEL is an integer.</i></p><br />

6. After saving `src/pwnbot.py`, you will need to run the following command in this repository:
```
$ docker build -t discord .
```
7. Finally, you can run this last command to run the Docker image and have it running in the background of your server:
```
$ docker run discord &
```
8. You should now be able to run `!help` to get started. ü§ñ
